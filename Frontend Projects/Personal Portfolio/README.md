# Personal Portfolio

This project aims to teach you how to style a website using **CSS**. You will build on the structure from a previous HTML-only project and apply various CSS techniques to enhance its appearance and responsiveness.

## Project Overview

In this project, you will:
- **Style** the HTML website structure you created previously.
- Focus on using **CSS** to create responsive layouts, apply color schemes, and choose appropriate typography.
- Create a well-structured, responsive website that adapts to different screen sizes (mobile and desktop).
- Follow the provided rough mockups for the structure and layout, without worrying about the design details (colors, backgrounds, etc.).

The goal is not to create a beautiful design at this stage, but to ensure that your website is **well-structured and responsive**.

4. **Responsive navigation bar**:
   - Create a navigation bar that adapts to different devices.
5. **Well-styled contact form**:
