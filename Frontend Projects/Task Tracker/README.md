# Task Tracker Project

This project involves creating a **task tracker** application that allows users to add, mark as complete, and delete tasks. The application will dynamically update the task list and provide a user-friendly interface to manage tasks efficiently.

## Project Overview

### Goal
The goal of this project is to:
- Practice **array manipulation** to manage tasks.
- Learn about **event handling** to handle user interactions.
- Develop skills in **dynamic DOM updates** using JavaScript.

The task tracker will feature:
- Adding new tasks.
- Marking tasks as complete or incomplete.
- Deleting tasks.
- Moving completed tasks to the end of the list with strikethrough styling.

### Instructions
1. **Data Structure**:
   - Store tasks in an array of objects. Each object should have properties like `description` and `status` (e.g., `completed` or `pending`).

2. **Functionality**:
   - Implement functions to:
     - Add new tasks.
     - Mark tasks as complete or incomplete.
     - Delete tasks.
     - Update the task list and reflect these changes in the DOM.

3. **Rendering Tasks**:
   - Write a function named `renderTasks` that will:
     - Remove all tasks from the DOM.
     - Re-render the tasks based on the updated tasks array.

### Mockup
A simple layout mockup is provided to guide the general structure. Feel free to adjust the design to enhance the user experience.

## Requirements

### Submission Requirements
1. **Task Management**:
   - Provide functionality to add, mark as complete, unmark, and delete tasks.
   - Ensure completed tasks are moved to the end of the list and are visually distinct with strikethrough styling.

2. **Dynamic DOM Updates**:
   - Use JavaScript to dynamically update the task list in the DOM based on user actions.

3. **Clean and Organized Code**:
   - Write clean and maintainable JavaScript code.
   - Follow best practices for array manipulation and event handling.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For structuring the task tracker interface.
- **CSS3**: For styling the task tracker and applying visual effects.
- **JavaScript**: For managing tasks and updating the DOM dynamically.

## Steps to Get Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Polqt/roadmap.sh
    ```
2. Open the project in your preferred code editor.
3. Implement the **HTML structure** for the task tracker.
4. Write **CSS** to style the task tracker and manage task appearance.
5. Develop the **JavaScript** functionality to handle task management and DOM updates.

## Customization

Feel free to:
- **Design** the task tracker interface to fit your style.
- **Enhance** the functionality, such as adding due dates or priority levels for tasks.
- **Implement** additional features like task filtering or sorting.

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this project, you will have a good understanding of:
- How to manage and manipulate arrays in JavaScript.
- How to handle user interactions and events.
- How to dynamically update the DOM based on user actions.

## Future Enhancements

Once you finish this project, you can:
- Add **local storage** to persist tasks between sessions.
- Implement **task filtering** (e.g., by status or priority).
- Explore **advanced features** such as task deadlines and reminders.

## Conclusion

By the end of this project, you'll have created a functional and interactive task tracker application. This project will enhance your skills in JavaScript, array manipulation, and dynamic DOM updates, laying the groundwork for more complex web applications.

Happy coding!
