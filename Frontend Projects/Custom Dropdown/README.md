# Custom Dropdown Menu

## Overview

This project involves creating a custom dropdown menu that allows users to select an item from a list. The dropdown will have three distinct states:
- **Default State**: Displays placeholder text.
- **Open State**: Reveals all available options.
- **Selected State**: Shows the chosen item and closes the dropdown.

The project aims to enhance your skills in DOM manipulation, event handling, and creating responsive and interactive elements using JavaScript.

## Features

- **Default State**: Shows placeholder text when no option is selected.
- **Open State**: Displays a list of options when the dropdown is clicked.
- **Selected State**: Highlights the chosen item and updates the dropdown to show the selected option.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the dropdown menu.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing DOM manipulation and event handling.
- **TailwindCSS**: For utility-first styling and responsive design.
- **jQuery**: For simplified DOM manipulation and event handling.

Feel free to adjust the sections according to your specific needs or preferences!

Happy Coding!
